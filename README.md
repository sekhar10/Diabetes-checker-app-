# Diabetes-checker-app

The aim of this analysis is to develop a system which might predict the diabetic risk level of a patient with a better accuracy.This app is deployed using Tkinter,a  standard GUI library for Python. Model development is based on categorization methods as Logistic Regression,Decision Tree, KNN and Naive Bayes algorithms. For Logistic Regression, the models give precisions of 83%, for Naive Bayes 79%,72% for Decision Tree and 77% for KNN.This app compares the results by these following algorithms and gives significant accuracy with these methods.
